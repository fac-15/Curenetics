        <p>
          Curenetics is a system that seemlessly matches a cancer patient to clinical trials after
          considering patientâ€™s preferences, unique genetic mutation in the cancer and best clinical
          match characteristics unique to every patient
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Currently, when a cancer patient has been told there are no further treatment options for
          them, many are left to look for clinical trial opportunities without much support from the
          cancer teams.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          There are clinical trials available but access to them depend on your location, your
          doctors knowledge of current trials and the ability of the patient to do a detailed search
          on google.
