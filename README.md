# Minimal React Boilerplate

This is a very minimal set-up to get started writing a React app. It bundles your code using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) and has [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) configured to write tests with [react-testing-library](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library).

## Getting started

### Quick start

1. Clone this repo
1. `npm i`
1. `npm run dev` to start the development server

### Slow start

If you want a bit more info about what exactly is needed for this project to work go to the [setup guide](./docs/setup.md) and follow the manual installation steps in a fresh repo of your own.
